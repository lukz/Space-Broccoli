### Description
Game is entirely based on Box2D Physics (Box2DLights for light) and it's debug draw. There are no assets in game nor win / lose condition.

Project was made for LibGDX Game Jam in ~15h during last two days of the jam. Despite being a jam game I made the code clean and readable so you should be able to find out how things work quite easily.
